## Re-dive runbook

For the next cold re-dive: `docs/predive_checklist.md` is the STANDING
pre-cold-dive gate; run `overnight_redive.sh` and watch with
`scripts/chain_status.py --chain overnight`. (Last bake: **2026-08-06/08**,
the v8 entries-12+13 engine -- ALL GREEN, mixed-vintage recovery proven;
see CHANGELOG "2026-08-06/08". LID STAYS OPEN for the whole bake.)

A failed chain step that has since been diagnosed and fixed goes in
`docs/chain_resolutions.toml` (read by `verify_overnight.py` check [1/5]) --
do NOT edit `overnight_status.txt` or the chain log to force the gate green.

**Don't use `publish_website.sh` (dry run) to ask "is the site current?"** It
regenerates guides + `index.html` on every invocation, so it rewrites the files
it then compares by mtime; it always reports a ~18-path delta even when the
content is identical. Compare content instead (md5 vs the live URLs, or
`rsync --checksum`). Detail in CHANGELOG "2026-08-04".

## DRY review 2026-08-05: fully executed -- open residue only

The review (`docs/reviews/2026-08-05_dry_review.md`) is fully executed
and signed off (plotly shim accepted as-is 2026-08-08, overlay-hue
aliasing recorded as a decision in docs/palette_governance.md section
6); the record lives in CHANGELOG and the report's status header.

Standing reference: the report's "Do NOT do" section lists the
intentional duplicates and refuted claims -- check it before
re-reporting any DRY finding.

## Engine bug-hunt round 2 (2026-07-03): 16 confirmed findings need triage

`docs/reviews/2026-07-02_engine_bug_hunt_round2.md` — 1 HIGH, 7 medium,
8 low; 0 uncertain; all double-skeptic-verified. ("No shipped winner flips
in sampled cells" held for the hunt's own samples; the NB-1 bounding sweep
below later found one on a wider grid.)

**Still open:**
- **js-parity residue** (LOW): js-parity-1 (tier precision, `c149f52`),
  -2 (mirror CMP, `82f0365`), -4 (gender mirror, `c956ed7`) and -5's
  minimal honest-claim half (`639ef1e`) were FIXED in the 2026-08-05 DRY
  arc. Remaining: **js-parity-3** (not re-checked during the DRY arc --
  verify against the round2 doc before scheduling) and **js-parity-5's M
  follow-on** (reconcile the three "Gives up vs #1" metrics / dedupe the
  two identical column labels).
- **[medium, NEW from the sweep, our own bug] would_shield/always-shield
  internal inconsistency:** the don't-bait override consumes
  `would_shield=False` while the active shield policy always shields
  (Florges vs Seismitoad UL 2-1 inflated +201). Independent of PvPoke
  fidelity; needs its own look. Detail in the sweep doc (carve-out
  section).
- Remaining report lows not yet actioned: **BP-3/BP-4** (Aegislash whole-level
  rounding gaps in iv_breakpoints/iv_bulkpoints), **FC-2** (Blade->Shield revert
  clamp rationale stale vs oracle) — details in the report; low, unscheduled.

### Open follow-ups (non-gating; render/tooling-only ones re-render from replay)

- **[tooling] dev-count `test_count` sentinel is a serialization point**
  (AFK-churn gate finding): six sentinel-bump commits raced across
  concurrent lanes in one 28-commit churn. Consider deriving the live
  count at gate time with the sentinel as a floor, or an auto-update
  mode -- small, low priority.

- **[tooling, silent-incompleteness] verify_overnight UL opponent-count
  assertion.** The completeness guard is GL-only; a UL opponent silently
  deranked by a fresh gamemaster would drop from every UL dive and still pass the
  gate GREEN. LATENT (UL 68/68 resolve on the current gamemaster). Needs a
  marker/expected-count design decision before asserting.
- **[tooling] F3: narrative auto-gen patch is WARN-not-FAIL** (`run_website_dives.py`
  ~624). Low; optional: surface the WARN where `verify_overnight` scans.
- **[render] `#opp-<slug>` canonical landing.** `#opp-` links land on the
  first-rendered mention; pick one canonical per-opponent target. Low; render-only.

## Top-N opponent filter + limited-cup dives (planned 2026-07-02)

From Reddit launch-post feedback (u/LeansCenter): (a) evaluate a focal vs
only the top 10/20/50 meta opponents, (b) limited-cup dives (Sunshine Cup
etc.), separate/composable. Full plan with recon evidence, phasing, and the
open decisions (UI shape, cup pilot choice, rollout vehicle):
`docs/topn_cup_filter_plan.md`. Headlines: top-N is a client-side mask over
the already-embedded SCORES_GZ grid plus a bake-time `oppMetaRank` field and
an honesty banner over the full-pool baked sections; cups are a pool+rankings
feature (PvPoke publishes cup rankings; sweep cache warm-serves overlapping
columns; ~minutes per focal, not a re-bake).

**Phases 1-2 SHIPPED** (2026-07; CHANGELOG "2026-07-03" + TODO_archive).
**Phase 3 remains**: more cups, legality-filter eval, app-side cup
toggles, mega engine -- see the plan doc.

## Cache GC: prune all namespaces + dive-script opt-in prompt

Make `scripts/gc_cache.py` able to prune **every** cache namespace, and wire a
prune option into the dive scripts wherever caches get created.

- **GC coverage.** Today only `sweep/` has vintage-aware pruning (gamemaster in
  `meta.json`); `slayer/` and `iv_envelope/` are report-only because they bake
  gamemaster+engine into opaque filename hashes with no readable vintage. Give
  those two a readable vintage (sidecar or meta file at write time) so GC can
  apply the same N-1 retention to them. (`iv_envelope/` may be retired instead
  once the ML path moves onto the sweep cache — cache-rework Phase 6.)
- **Dive-script opt-in.** Wherever a cache is created (`deep_dive.py`,
  `deep_dive_slayer.py`, the IV-envelope/ML path, sweep), add a prune option
  that **defaults to "don't prune."** When the run is a *full* dive of a whole
  league (UL / GL / ML), **ask Michael whether to prune** before/after the dive
  rather than silently keeping or silently deleting.
- Retention target stays N-1 (current gamemaster + 1 prior), matching the
  existing `gc_cache.py --keep-vintages 2` default.

## NEXT SESSION (queued 2026-06-21): gobattlekit owned-mon breakdown screen

Build the "which of my mons should I build?" breakdown in the gobattlekit iOS
app — the same feature already live on the website (the deep-dive paste-box
"Gives up vs #1" column) and as a Python reference (`scripts/owned_breakdown.py`).

- **Scope (decided):** GL + UL, the species we've already dived (zero new sims,
  smallest mobile bundle).
- **Architecture:** EXTRACT per-IV dropped-vs-rank-1 from existing dive grids
  (no re-sim) — the dive embeds the full 4096-IV score grid. gobattlekit has NO
  battle engine and must not get one (lean iOS build); it consumes pre-baked
  data + recomputes only the analytic layer on-device.
- **One remaining build step** (step 1, the bitmask exporter, shipped
  2026-06-29 `c1ea231` -- details in TODO_archive):
  2. **Toga screen** modeled on `gobattlekit/src/gobattlekit/screens/user_iv_checker.py`,
     reading the baked artifact (bundle like `default_thresholds.toml` via
     `tools/threshold_export/`); resolve owned mons through their evolution line;
     **add parity vectors** to gobattlekit `tests/test_parity_vectors.py`.
- **Full plan + findings + file:line pointers:** `docs/owned_mon_breakdown_plan.md`.
  Memory: `project_owned_mon_breakdown.md`. Convention note: web + iOS use the
  dive's opponent IVs; the Python CLI uses 15/15/15 (they differ slightly).

## Old/new mechanics user toggle (POST-SHIP)

*(2026-06-26, Michael)* Post-ship idea, flagged so it is not lost; do NOT
pre-ship or design heavily yet. If the site/app gets traction, P!P-series /
Worlds competitors may want it for prep, and **Worlds runs on the OLD battle
mechanics**. So expose a user-facing toggle between old and new mechanics on
the dive site.

Light design notes (not yet designed):
- Preference storage: cookies (never used here) vs radio buttons vs a query
  param. Look at what PvPoke does for its "Preview next season" version as
  prior art before picking.
- Cache: the cache-rework (shipped 2026-06-27, CHANGELOG) does NOT key on the
  turn model, so a `new`-mechanics dive force-disables the sweep cache today.
  Adding a real toggle means keying the cache by mechanics so old-vs-new
  results cache separately while our engine stays current — extend
  `sweep_cache`/`migrate_cache` rather than re-deriving them.

## Form-change "starts in alt form" dives + on-page descriptions (POST-PUBLISH)

*(2026-06-26, Michael)* Aegislash got fixed pre-launch (relabeled "Starts
Blade" + a top-of-page form-change note on both GL dives) because it was the
only form-change dive that read as confusing on the site. The rest is
deferred post-publish:

- **If a Morpeko dive is ever added, it must carry a form-change note at the
  top too** (Full Belly <-> Hangry toggles AURA_WHEEL Electric/Dark after
  each charged move). Same `_FORM_CHANGE_NOTES` mechanism.

## Limited-availability mons: real IV floors for ML sweeps (PARALLEL, post-ship)

*(2026-06-25, scratch_thoughts)* The ML IV-guide sweeps assume a 12/12/12 IV
floor (right for traded / grind-able species). But some mons you only get one
or two of in PoGo -- mostly mythicals (Marshadow, Hoopa, Zygarde) but NOT all
(Genesect is grind-able; Marshadow/Hoopa/Zygarde are not). Their real-world IV
floor is LOWER than 12/12/12, so the shipped ML guide can't evaluate a
legitimately owned spread (Michael's Marshadow is 11/13/11). Steps: (1)
enumerate which species are in the limited-availability category, (2) determine
each one's IRL IV floor (research-reward / quest-encounter IVs), (3) re-run the
ML sweep for any with a floor below 12/12/12. Independent of everything else --
fire as a PARALLEL task, ship whatever is done, re-ship the corrected guides
later (they finish after the UI decisions, or get rewritten during UI rework).
FLAG (never-ship-unflagged-known-wrong rule): until corrected, the limited-mon
ML guides ship with a floor that is wrong for them -- decide whether to add an
"assumes a 12/12/12 IV floor" caveat on those pages or ship unflagged.

Resolved slice (floor-10 resweeps, enumeration research, shadow-legendary
gap) recorded in TODO_archive + `docs/reviews/2026-07-03_limited_availability_iv_floors.md`.
STILL OPEN (both need Michael, both optional/low): (a) OPTIONAL belt-and-
suspenders -- evaluate Dialga/Latias/Lugia/Reshiram (Shadow) down to 6/6/6 in
their ML guides (the four Giovanni-primary legendaries whose grindability is
only medium-confidence; worst-case floor is a bounded 6/6/6); (b) re-run the
audit when Eternatus returns (Niantic announced it will).

## Pre-ship arc — residual open polish

The 2026-04/06 pre-ship arc shipped (site published 2026-06-07; see
CHANGELOG.md). The minor polish residue:

- **G16 — methodology-details guide pointer.** Replace the
  in-article hidden-but-present methodology prose with a one-line
  guide pointer (the hide layer is already in place; G16 is the
  last-mile substitution). ~30 min.

- **G1 + G2 + G7 — richer auto-gen prose template** [post-ship,
  recommended]. F1 Meta Role, F2 key-flips callout, and
  F-fast/charge-moves shipped as deterministic rollups; JRE-style
  prose ("Mud Slap takes Male Oinkologne from 0% to 76.6% vs
  Steelix — the signature upgrade") would close the register
  gap. Template change, not Claude-drafted prose, so
  ship-policy-clean. 0.5-1 session. Benefits every future dive.
  Bundles with **Row D** — bulk-vs-peers paragraph (micro-gap from
  original §3.D, never made it through F1's auto-gen template).

- **F-tier-name-cleanup** [post-ship] — simplify IV-rec tier card
  names (current: `Steelix (Shadow) Slayer -   (Wigglytuff Slayer
  -   (Wigglytuff Atk))`) to RyanSwag's name/signature convention
  per `docs/reference_deep_dives/ryanswag/STYLE_ANALYSIS.md`.
  Bundles with S5a rename work in post-S5 arc.

- **F-shadow-narrative** [post-ship] — Shadow-variant comparison
  prose block for species that have shadow forms (not applicable
  to Oinkologne ship).

- **F5** [post-ship, gated ≥3-5 shipped articles] —
  multi-article-reader cross-linking footer. Not worth building
  until cross-reference surface is large enough.

- **R3 removal candidate.** Meta Coverage "Shield asymmetry
  dominates the extremes" explanatory paragraph — currently
  hidden; re-evaluate for removal post-ship if hide reads as
  bloat.

- **Personal-collection: `scripts/suggest_builds.py`.** CLI
  helper: takes `--species`, `--league`, `--roles lead,closer`,
  path to a PokeGenie CSV export, and the shipped dive HTML.
  Parses Top IVs + Anchors + Matchup Flip tables, intersects with
  the collection, prints a ranked shortlist per role with the key
  tradeoffs (atk/HP/def, anchor flips, score Δ, XL/dust cost).
  Maybe 2-3 hours; deprioritize if scatter paste-box overlay +
  Mirror CMP columns are enough.

- **CD-prep tracking — delete `[cd_prep]` blocks** after the
  Oinkologne CD ships, or after PvPoke stably lists Mud Slap for
  2+ gamemaster refreshes. The auto-injection plumbing
  (`enumerate_movesets(..., cd_prep_fast=, cd_prep_charged=)`,
  commit `e61c14e`) stays.

- **P2 single-form opponent links.** `_render_matchup_delta_section`
  (line 1954) doesn't yet link opponent cells — applies to
  non-CD articles that aren't per-form. Extend when the first
  such article actually ships.

- **P3 article-surface design question.** Dive-side envelope-tag
  retrofit shipped 2026-04-23 (`patch_dive_envelope_tags.py`);
  a category-card surface on the CD article itself (linking
  envelope-shape to a specific "Cost to XL" judgment) remains
  the original P3 question and has not been addressed.

- **Cross-form opponent expansion (parked).** Item 4 (auto-
  form-sibling expansion in `build_opponent_pool.py`) — design
  done but parked pending review of rendered Oinkologne article;
  decide pool-level vs render-level filter for hypothetical-form
  rows. See memory `project_form_change_pool_expansion_parked.md`.

## Deferred cleanup: backwards-compatibility removal pass

The S7 dead-code removal pass ran 2026-06-12 (see CHANGELOG). Still open
(deliberately NOT cut in S7):

- **Gobattlekit threshold schema compatibility** in
  `gopvpsim.user_collection.check_thresholds` (and `as_legacy_dict` in
  thresholds.py) — once gobattlekit has actually migrated to use the
  shared module and we've confirmed it works, we may want to simplify
  the dict schema or unify with pogo-simulator's TOML anchor schema.
  But not before gobattlekit's migration lands. **The gobattlekit
  threshold pipeline actively consumes both as of 2026-06-12 — do not
  touch without coordinating.**
- **§I consolidations** (L11 gamemaster index, L15 unified
  invalidate_caches + effective-stats primitive, L6 league descriptor,
  D9 SweepConfig, D14 tier recompute, R11 shared scenario/color
  helpers, W8 slug parser, W10 badge renderer, T8 conftest deep_dive
  loader) — deferred from S7: D9/D14/T8 are seams the dedicated
  deep_dive.py split session will rework anyway, and the library
  consolidations (L6/L11/L15) are behavior-adjacent refactors, not
  deletions. Bundle them with the split session or their natural
  feature sessions.

## Battle simulator

* **PvPoke bug reports: FILED 2026-07-16** (CHANGELOG has the full
  writeup): pvpoke/pvpoke #378 Gyro Ball, #379 Morpeko, #380 dead
  pruning, #381 DPE overwrite, #382 bestChargedMove question. Residual
  opens:
  - **Report 5 (needsBoost retired-or-returning question) held back** —
    paste-ready in `docs/pvpoke_bug_reports.md`; if filed later, adjust
    the opener's "5 reports today" line and re-check
    `git log 10fd1a6e4..master -- src/js/` first.
  - **Engage with Matt's responses** as they come (volunteer,
    ~two-week cycles; don't re-ping).
  - **[investigation, unexplained] site-vs-headless 429/510
    discrepancy:** pvpoke.com single-battle UI gives 429 where headless
    runs of the byte-identical engine + gamemaster + inputs give 510
    (Aegislash SB-only vs Azumarill, the knife-edge "3 turns can flip"
    cells; reproduces at both April and July vintages, robust to
    bait/OMT/levels/IVs sweeps). Some UI-side battle setup input we
    haven't identified. Detail in `docs/pvpoke_bug_reports.md` header.
    Low priority, but don't cite harness battle ratings as
    site-reproducible in razor-thin cells until resolved.

* **Known PvPoke divergences** — DEVELOPER_NOTES "Known divergences"
  is the single source of truth (bestChargedMove per-turn recompute,
  the near-KO plan cluster, the battle-timeout guard). Re-audit
  anytime: `python scripts/audit_oracle_harness.py` (covers GL + UL;
  current baseline 207 cells = 172 exact + 35 documented; re-audited
  2026-08-06 A/B at origin/main vs the entry-13 batch, identical both
  sides -- the old 170+37 went stale at the hunt2 merge).

* **Speed test** -- compare our speed vs the PvPoke JS code, look for
  ways we can speed ours up. *(Partly addressed 2026-06-10: holistic
  perf review found and fixed a 2.0x engine regression dating to the
  2026-04-15 correctness arc — see DEVELOPER_NOTES "Performance
  baseline" for the regression gate and `docs/perf/` for the writeup.
  The vs-PvPoke-JS throughput comparison itself remains open.)*

## Shared user_collection module — Option-2 migration prep

*(from gobattlekit's 2026-06-11/12 deep review, sections F/J — CP9 +
CP12. Not urgent; gobattlekit is otherwise ready to consume
`gopvpsim.user_collection` and has aligned its matching semantics to
ours. The CP4 over-leveled-mon fix and CP13 Burmy→Mothim fix shipped
here 2026-06-12; these are the remaining seams.)*

* **Split heavy deps into extras** — `pyproject.toml` hard-requires
  `numpy` + `markdown`, but the `user_collection` import path
  (user_collection → evolution_lines + pokemon → data) needs neither.
  numpy on iOS via BeeWare is a real packaging problem. Move them to
  an extra (e.g. `gopvpsim[sim]`) so a mobile app can take a core
  dependency. Note the user_collection docstring's "stdlib only"
  claim is false at package level until `certifi` (imported by
  data.py at module load) is also dealt with.

* **Injectable gamemaster/CPM source** — `match_mons` hardwires
  `get_pokemon_index()` → data.py's network-backed cache
  (`~/Documents/gopvpsim_cache/`, 24h TTL, NoDataError when offline
  with no cache). gobattlekit needs to supply its own bundled +
  ETag-cached gamemaster. Add a provider injection point (parameter
  or settable loader) on match_mons / get_pokemon_index /
  evolution_lines.

* **Golden parity-vector emitter** *(seeded by the gobattlekit
  threshold-pipeline session, 2026-06-12)* — a script that emits
  (species, IVs, level) → (stats, CP, rank) fixtures from our
  canonical primitives, checked into gobattlekit as test vectors so
  its stat math can't drift from ours. Complements the CSV parity
  corpus below (that one covers parsing/matching; this covers the
  arithmetic).

* **Shared CSV parity corpus (CP12)** — a small synthetic CSV
  (shadow, over-cap, out-of-range, gendered, branched-evo rows) +
  golden expected-results JSON, checked into BOTH repos and run by
  both suites, so the row-for-row contract can't silently drift
  again (it demonstrably did: gender, shadow, level-gating). Until
  Option 2 deletes the duplicate implementation, this is the only
  tripwire.

## Tests to add

* **Guard for the IV-scanner `maxLevel` single-source (fixed `725c184`).**
  **A full implementable design now exists:**
  `docs/reviews/2026-06-28_iv_scanner_maxlevel_strong_pin_design.md` (the
  cheap Option-1 pin: extract `build_collection_data()` from deep_dive.py +
  a 4-league unit test; supersedes this entry's "Heavy / needs a dive render
  + CSV fixture" framing, and refreshes this entry's stale SHA/line numbers).
  The `verify_js_parser.py` league-blindness half was fixed 2026-07-03
  (`c20071e`); the deep_dive.py extraction was waiting on the top-N/cup
  session (file conflict) -- that session LANDED (Phase 1 + Equinox Phase 2
  shipped; unblocked 2026-08-05), so the extraction is now schedulable.
  Original context: no test pins
  `_collection_data['maxLevel']` to `LEAGUE_MAX_LEVEL.get(league)`, so a
  future re-hardcode could silently re-introduce the GL/UL "owned mons one
  level too high" bug. **The whole 51.0 cluster half of this entry was
  FIXED 2026-08-05** (DRY review entries 9+10, `c956ed7`):
  `user_collection.py`'s four defaults are None-means-derive via
  `league_max_level`/`max_level_for_cap`, the
  `deep_dive_user_collection.js` mirrors derive from the league, and the
  `verify_js_parser.py` fixture is league-aware with Oinkologne +
  requireGender coverage. gobattlekit PORTS the module (its own copy still
  defaults 51 -- noted in the module docstring; pass caps explicitly when
  comparing). STILL OPEN here: only the `build_collection_data()`
  extraction + 4-league unit test (the strong pin), which bundles with the
  deep_dive.py split session.

* **pvpoke.com/battle browser round-trip for the iv-tech oracles**
  (the one human step left from the old "No-bait oracle tests" entry;
  everything else DONE 2026-08-08, AFK churn `000ea87`+`cc64923`, both
  reference claims REPRODUCE with mechanisms read off battle timelines
  -- Tinkaton 0-1 vs Shadow Altaria bulkpoint at def=143.04, Spidops 1s
  vs Altaria Sky-Attack reduction -- and the "more forgiving win
  threshold" follow-up resolved: bait-ON wins for every spread are real,
  the reference's claim is specifically no-bait). Round-trip the key
  cells at pvpoke.com/battle when convenient.

## Refactoring

* **Pain points captured during real debugging** — see memory file
  `project_post_ship_cleanup_pain_points.md` (silent early-returns
  with no logging, no replay-from-saved-state mode, hardcoded magic
  numbers assuming `nS=9`, parallel call-site duplication,
  free-form-string opponent identity, `data_obj`-as-mutable-bag,
  `id()`-keyed caches). Specific friction encountered while
  diagnosing the 2026-04-25 mirror-tier-synthesis no-fire bug;
  read this *before* starting the deep_dive.py split below so the
  cuts address actual pain rather than aesthetic ones.

* **Split `scripts/deep_dive.py`** *(deferred from 2026-04-09; not
  blocking, but file is now ~6100 lines as of 2026-04-10)* — After the structured IV
  categories shipped, the file is approaching the size where edits
  start fighting the line-cap. Concrete extraction targets, in rough
  order of independence:
  1. **`scripts/deep_dive_lib/categories.py`** — `IVCategory` dataclass,
     `build_iv_categories()`, `_stat_cutoffs_from_anchors()`,
     `_format_stat_cutoffs()`, `_composite_tradeoff_prose()`,
     `_matchup_subtitle()`. Pure-Python, already isolated, already has
     unit tests in `tests/test_iv_categories.py`. Easiest move.
  2. **`scripts/deep_dive_lib/anchor_flips.py`** — `_aggregate_flips_by_anchor()`,
     `_render_anchor_flip_bullets()`. Pure-Python, already isolated,
     already has tests in `tests/test_flip_aggregator.py`.
  3. **`scripts/deep_dive_lib/slayer.py`** — `iterative_slayer_discovery()`,
     `categorize_slayers()`, `_slayer_iter_worker()`, related helpers.
     The multiprocessing entry points complicate this — workers are
     resolved by qualified name, so the move requires careful import
     plumbing.
  4. **`scripts/deep_dive_lib/render.py`** — `generate_analysis_sections()`,
     the per-section helpers (`_render_notable_ivs_section`,
     `_iv_label`, `_tier_badge_html`, `_threshold_desc`,
     `_hover_text`, etc.), the CSS string. This is the actual monster
     (~1500 lines and growing). Needs a small "renderer context"
     dataclass first to avoid passing a 15-arg tuple around.
  5. **`scripts/deep_dive_lib/sweep.py`** — `iv_sweep()`, the worker
     init/run pair, `screen_movesets()`, `compute_iv_metadata()`,
     `group_ivs_by_stat_profile()`. Numba-touching code; same
     multiprocessing import-plumbing concern as slayer.
  Remaining in `scripts/deep_dive.py` after all five steps: argument
  parsing, the top-level orchestration in `main()`, and the legacy
  non-interactive `generate_html()` (already on the chopping block —
  see "Non-interactive `generate_html` is now strictly worse" above).
  Test split: each module gets its own `tests/test_<module>.py`; the
  existing tests already prove the importlib pattern works for
  modules that can't import from `gopvpsim` directly.
  **Recommendation**: do this in a dedicated session, not interleaved
  with feature work — refactor diffs and feature diffs shouldn't ride
  the same commit. Mechanical (file moves + import fixes) so it
  shouldn't take long once started; the risk is multiprocessing
  worker resolution and CSS-string fragment positioning.

## Moveset / variant comparison tool

* **N=3 / N=4 renderer support for `compare_loadouts.py`** — MVP
  (N=2) shipped 2026-04-18. N=4 ceiling covers the canonical
  (moveset × form) cross (e.g. Forretress: Volt Switch / Bug Bite ×
  Shadow / normal). Remaining work: N=3 and N=4 renderer support,
  plus verdict templating for N-way ranking (MVP keeps verdict
  simple, just for Male-vs-Female).

  Design constraint: stay loadout-list-keyed, not A/B-keyed
  (`loadouts: list[LoadoutSpec]`, pairwise-delta iteration via
  `itertools.combinations`). N=4 ceiling: more than 4 makes the
  matchup-delta table unreadable. Don't design past this.

## User-facing documentation (post-arc)

The Reader's Guide arc shipped 2026-04-23/24 — infrastructure
(`build_guides.py`, landing page, dev-count sentinels), plus seven
guide bodies, ALL at `authorship=both` as of 2026-07 (the old
"pending review" note here was stale). A 56-agent staleness audit ran
2026-07-07 (43 findings applied; detail in TODO_archive). An eighth
guide, **Matchup Clusters**
(`guides/matchup-clusters/`), was drafted at `authorship=ai` for the
new dive section — MICHAEL: review + promote to `both`.

Open follow-ups:

- **Review the Matchup Clusters guide** (`authorship=ai` -> `both`).
- **Two stale screenshots** (low): `envelope-position/screenshots/
  envelope-example.png` (pre-rename "Top Picks" legend) and
  `iv-flavor-guide/screenshots/flavor-example.png` (pre-2026-06-25
  purple theme; zone is teal now) — retake from HEAD-rendered dives
  when convenient.
- **Round-3 screenshots** if/when reader confusion surfaces a
  specific gap (round-1 + round-2 screenshots shipped via `32fae84`
  and `e449b38`).
- **Add topics** beyond the five shipped — Michael asked that the
  topic list be a conversation at the start of the task, not a
  fixed scope. Plan a session to (a) add topics surfaced by
  an HSH Discord member / new readers, (b) reorder by current reader
  confusion, (c) decide whether related topics merge.

The IV Flavor Guide write-up is owed to an HSH Discord member per
`project_acidic_arisen_writeup_commitment.md` — promoting that
guide from `ai` to `expert` is the closing of that commitment.

## Low priority

* **ML guide "what do I get by best-buddying these?" view** — the "All
  cases" IV-compare view (shipped 2026-06-28, `b494b28`) hides
  best-buddy-conditional flips by default and badges their count
  ("N best-buddy flips hidden"). A natural follow-up is a dedicated
  summary that answers, for the user's candidate spreads, *what
  matchups best-buddying unlocks/loses* — e.g. "best-buddy 15/15/14 to
  win Solgaleo 2-1 + Kyurem 2-2; 15/14/15 gains nothing." The data is
  already there (the alt grids / sibling quadrant rows); this is a
  rendering/summarization feature, not new sim. Deferred 2026-06-28 by
  Michael ("don't want to engineer that now").

* **Team/multi-mon simulation** — currently only 1v1; real PvP is 3v3 with
  switching. Add team composition and switch-timing support. When this
  lands, honor `reset_on_switch`: Morpeko must re-enter in Full Belly on
  every switch-in (confirmed in-game 2026-06-06; see DEVELOPER_NOTES §8).
  Also port the MATCH-level 240 s clock (Michael, 2026-06-11): the real
  game's timer spans the whole 3v3, charged-move animations consume it,
  and games are genuinely won on time — see DEVELOPER_NOTES "Battle
  timeout" divergence entry for PvPoke's clock semantics to mirror.

## Backlog (someday / maybe) — see `docs/TODO_backlog.md`

The long-tail design notes / research reproductions / UI wishlist live in
`docs/TODO_backlog.md` (split out 2026-06-28 to keep this file readable in one
shot). All still open — detail preserved verbatim there. Index of what's there:

- **Policies to add** — Selective baiting, random buff/debuff modes, EV-based
  baiting, new-mechanics decision-layer re-optimization.
- **Analysis goals** — RyanSwag-style matchup-flip annotations + wins y-axis,
  meta-wide slayer reference, SwagTips/reddit/iv-tech reproductions, the
  Tinkaton scatter-cluster + clustering-methodology investigations.
- **Slayer card UX** — signal-loss systemic audit (saturation of slayer/tier
  badges).
- **Slayer iteration cleanup** — Max-Wins column, Lurgan-as-opponent re-run,
  validation-doc reframe.
- **HTML output paths** — orphaned-artifact detector,
  mirror-slayer table size (mechanism removed; demote-vs-optimize).
- **Dive card** — High-HP strictly-dominated-spread bug, opponent-IV
  robustness axis, signature-dedup notes.
- **Upcoming plan-mode session** — dive/article content + information
  architecture (articles-vs-dives taxonomy, card placement, ML enrichment).
- **CD article generator** — S8 envelope-annotation wiring.
- **Deep-dive narrative** — (move-display DRY lifted to Refactoring above),
  catch-phrase tier, narrative-flavor plot tiers, TOML composite categories,
  RyanSwag-style autogenerated section.
- **Reproducibility** — non-reproducible opponent data (fingerprint + logging).
- **UI / Display** — scatter color modes, pretty-print names, CLI help
  enumeration, table sorting, client-side anchor add/remove.
- **Schema simplification** — TOML simplification triggers (collect friction).
