# Developer Notes

## Current status (2026-04-06)

120 tests pass (102 original + 9 shadow + 9 Corviknight mirror). The simulator matches PvPoke's
simulate-mode score table exactly (±0) for 8 matchups (72 cells). The 3
remaining failures are all Mienfoo vs Medicham, root-caused to a
`bestChargedMove` selection difference (see below).

### Verified correct
- **Type effectiveness**: All 324 matchups match PvPoke exactly
- **Damage formula**: Verified against manual calculation
- **Buff/debuff mechanics**: Guaranteed buff (Beedrill 9/9), chance buff
  (Corviknight 9/9), self-debuff meter threshold
- **DP queue insertion**: Three PvPoke strategies ported (farm-down <=,
  ready <=+dedup, not-ready <)
- **selfBuffing/selfDebuffing flags**: Match PvPoke's chance thresholds
  (==1 for selfBuffing, >=0.5 for selfDebuffing)
- **Shield policy**: pvpoke_simulate_shield uses precomputed flags
- **Shadow Pokemon**: ×1.2 atk / ×(5/6) def multipliers match PvPoke's
  SHADOW_ATK=1.2, SHADOW_DEF=0.83333331. Shadow Swampert vs Registeel 9/9.
- **Both-side buffs**: Corviknight mirror (Air Cutter only) 9/9. Both mons'
  buffApplyMeter fires independently; unbuffed Air Cutter does 18, buffed does 23.

### Previously failing: Mienfoo vs Medicham — FIXED (all 9/9)

Two bugs were found and fixed:

1. **wouldShield buff reset ordering** (battle.py `would_shield`):
   The charged-move threat loop ran BEFORE resetting the temporarily-
   applied stat buffs, inflating damage predictions. PvPoke resets
   buffs first (ActionLogic.js:1136-1140), then evaluates charged-move
   threat (lines 1145-1165). Fix: moved the reset before the loop.

2. **CMP (Charge Move Priority) cancellation** (battle.py `simulate`):
   When both Pokemon fire charged moves simultaneously, the lower-ATK
   Pokemon's move should be canceled if it was KO'd by the higher-ATK
   Pokemon's charged move (PvPoke Battle.js:464-467). Our code had an
   exception that always allowed both to fire. Fix: track `charged_ko`
   set and cancel if `use_priority` and attacker was KO'd by a charged
   move.

## PvPoke bugs found

### 1. BattleState .hp/.oppHealth naming inconsistency

**File**: `ActionLogic.js:1187` (class definition) vs lines 479, 600, 697

PvPoke's `BattleState` stores `.oppHealth` and `.oppShields`, but the
dominance checks reference `.hp` and `.shields` (undefined in JS →
always false → dead code). The dedup check at line 545 correctly uses
`.oppHealth`.

We added an `intended_pruning` flag to `pvpoke_dp` that toggles between
PvPoke's actual behavior (dead-code pruning, `False`) and the apparently
intended behavior (functional pruning, `True`).

## Key implementation details

### DP queue insertion (pvpoke_dp)

PvPoke uses three different insertion strategies in the DP queue:
1. **Farm-down** (`<=`): insert after same-turn states
2. **Ready-move** (`<=` + dedup): dedup at exact turn, then insert after
3. **Not-ready-move** (`<`): insert before same-turn, giving charged-move
   KO paths priority over farm-down

The `<` for not-ready states is critical — it produced 2 exact PvPoke
matches and several closer scores for Azu vs Forretress.

### selfBuffing / selfDebuffing thresholds

PvPoke gates these flags on `buffApplyChance`:
- `selfBuffing`: chance == 1 only (guaranteed buffs)
- `selfDebuffing`: chance >= 0.5 (excludes low-chance like HJK at 10%)
- `DRAGON_ASCENT` is explicitly excluded from selfDebuffing

These flags control the shield policy: guaranteed self-buff moves use
the `wouldShield` heuristic, while chance-buff moves are always shielded.
